# GDB-Tutorial
A Simple Tutorial of GDB. This tutorial are mainly from CPPCon 2015 and CPPCon 2016.


## CPPCon 2015: Give Me 15 Minutes and I'll Change Your View of GDB

This is a lightning talk about 15 minutes, which gives a simple introduction of how to use GDB in a clever way.

By this video, you will learn how to use GDB as a mordern developer rather than a developer of neanderthalensis. :)

## CPPCon2016: GDB - a lot more than you realized

Due to limited time, Greg only gives a 15 minutes lighting presention in CPPCon 2015. So in CPPCon 2016, Greg was invited to give a full CPPCon presentation.

All skills presented in CPPCon 2015 are covered in CPPCon 2016, so I highly recommend you watch 2016's full version.
